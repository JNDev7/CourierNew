# CourierNew
A unique mail system plugin for for your Spigot Minecraft server

CourierNew is a mail system that allows players to write letters into books with a command and then send these letters to players. The players are delivered by a postman entity, and the player must then interact with the entity to recieve their letters.

Detailed information can be found on the plugin page, which is linked at the top of the repo.

Notice: bits of this plugin are currently being rewritten as some parts are poorly done. I now realize this after a couple of college courses.
