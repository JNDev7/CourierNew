# CourierNew
A unique mail system plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers

CourierNew is a physical mail system for spigot mincraft servers that allows users to send letters in the form of books and receive them through couriers. Admins can use this to send letters to all players at once as a way of sending a message that people will be sure to see.

Detailed information can be found on the plugin page, which is linked at the top of the repo.
